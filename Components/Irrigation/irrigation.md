## Equipment

A [mini water pump](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/122508463023) powered by 5V on the Arduino board

## Duration

As tested on 16.6.2021, it requires about 300-400ml water to fully irrigate completely dry soil on the 24-well-plate_2.0. Water pump should first turn on for 6 sec, then shut for 10 min to dampen the soil, then turn on again for 6 sec to fully wet the soil.
