# Todo list for the plant growth chamber project

## Application
  **Deadline:**
Things to prepare and decide:
Che wrote: 
* Plan for the project: for the application use and project management.
* Learning from other projects: ongoing.
* Coding method: adurino IDE or XOD or Others.
* Chamber Dimension: What size should it be?
* Sensors: a draft plan like how many sensors? where to put them?
* Actuators: Lights---what wavelenghth?; Water Pump; Robotic Arms---What function we want to achieve with them.
* Flow Chart: Basic logic to link sensors and actuators. To illustrate how things work.

>All good!

## Knowledge Requirements
### Electrical Sensors
Che wrote: 
* How do we communicate with sensors? clock
* How we process the data reading from sensors?
* Data log and plots.
* Initializing and calibration. [ZD] Temp: using a thermometer; Light intensity: ZD can borrow a professional one from lab; humidity: buy a professional one from Amazon?
* Camera-> [ZD] There are many camera modules for Raspberry Pi but not as many for Arduino (as far as I know...). So (1) use Raspberry Pi (2) search for more Arduino projects with camera; (3) search for adapters to connect Arduino and Raspberry Pi cameras.

### WiFi modules
  Che wrote:
* How do we achieve remote control and communication through WiFi? ->[ZD] For Raspberry Pi it is very straightforward as it has built-in WiFi module, for Arduino there are some modules based on the [ESP8266 microchip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) such as  Adafruit Feather HUZZAH (I have this!) or SparkFun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board.
  
### Programming on Hardware
Che wrote:  
* Syntax of the programming language;
* Debug and tests scheme.
* Development tools.

### DIY

ZD:
- chamber (Should have enough insulation for heat)
- plates for growing Arabidopsis
- scaffolds to mount sensors 


Che wrote:
* 3D printing and CAD models.
* Robotic arms
