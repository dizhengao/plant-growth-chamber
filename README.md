# Plant Growth Chamber

## Overview and Perspective
This project aims at building an automated plant growth chamber to grow and monitor *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings for plant research. The chamber will be equipped with following the features:

1. Provide a humidity, light and temperature-controlled environment which reach to **research level** - meaning that we aim at implementing it in real plant research and experiments conducted in given growth conditions are reproducible. 
2. **Real-time monitoring** of plant growth (camera +  humidity, light and temperature data) though Arduino WiFi module or Raspberry Pi.
3. Pumps for **auto-irrigation**. 
4. A **robotic arm** that can be used to perform some manual control remotely.
6. **Expandable** to larger scale and allow customable purposes. 
5. [Hopefully we can also develop a method to sow small *Arabidopsis* seeds automatically (maybe start with tobacco seeds which are larger!)]

The project will be based on 3D printing, Arduino (maybe together with Raspberry Pi), robotic arm and more.

### Motivation
*Arabidopsis thaliana* is model plant species widely used in plant research. The labor that has been put into growing and taking caring of those plants by researchers all over the world is unimaginable. We propose that simple automation designs could greatly speed up this processes and save researchers' time. [How automation can help xxx]

>TODO: High-throughput screening of many arabidopsis on a plate. 

>TODO: Generalization to other purposes and other plant species.
