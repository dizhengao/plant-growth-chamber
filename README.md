# Plant Chamber
[Link](https://www.hackster.io/biomaker-2019-team-8/ctod-from-cells-to-droplets-2b3b4f 'this is not yet the link to plant-chamber project') to hackster to be added here.
## Overview and Perspective
This project aims at building a small plant growth chamber to grow *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings on multi-well plates. The chamber will be equipped with following the features:

1. Humidity, light and temperature-controlled.
2. Real-time monitoring of plant growth (camera +  humidity, light and temperature data) though Arduino WiFi module or Raspberry Pi.
3. Pump for auto-irrigation. 
4. A robotic arm that can be used to perform some manual control remotely.
5. [Hopefully we can also develop a method to sow small *Arabidopsis* seeds automatically]

The project will be based on 3D printing, Arduino (maybe together with Raspberry Pi) and robotic arm.

### Motivation
*Arabidopsis thaliana* is model plant species widely used in plant research. The labor that has been put into growing and taking caring of those plants by researchers all over the world is unimaginable. We propose that simple automation designs could greatly speed up this processes and save researchers' time. [How automation can help xxx]

>TODO: High-throughput screening of many arabidopsis on a plate.

>TODO: Generalization to other purposes and other plant species.


## Start
Idea started in mid 2020. Documentation started on 12.11.2020.
Real project has not started but will be soon (hopefully...).
## Folder Index
1. 3D: Files for the 3D printing parts.
2. Code: .ino files for Arduino.
3. Design: Ideas and graphs.
4. Application: application files (will not be included in the final github page).
