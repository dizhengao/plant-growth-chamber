# Todo list for the plant growth chamber project

## Application
  **Deadline:**
Things to prepare and decide:
Che wrote: 
* Plan for the project: for the application use and project management.
* Learning from other projects: ongoing.
* Coding method: adurino IDE or XOD(如果我没有ji cuo名字的hua) or Others.
* Chamber Dimension: What size should it be?
* Sensors: a draft plan like how many sensors? where to put them?
* Actuators: Lights---what wavelenghth?; Water Pump; Robotic Arms---What function we want to achieve with them.
* Flow Chart: Basic logic to link sensors and actuators. To illustrate how things work.

What do you think? Any comments?
