- Some Hackster projects: 
    - https://www.hackster.io/lunaflow/lunaflow-bioluminescent-plankton-for-3d-flow-visualisation-d60cbe -> incubator design, **temperature control**, real-time monitor camera, codes.

- Refer to some plant growth products from https://gard.in/ (This is very expensive so probably we won't use them in our project.)

- Some facility that has been using in real plant research (e.g. in PGF)
